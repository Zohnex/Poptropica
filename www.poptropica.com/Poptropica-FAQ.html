<P>To reset the password, begin by entering the username on the Returning Player login page, without entering any password, and then click the "OK" button. Poptropica will display a "forgot password" link. Click that "forgot password" link, and then click the "OK" button. Poptropica will send an email to the parent with instructions for creating a new password for the child's account.</p>

<P>If the player's account does not have a parent email address recorded and verified for this purpose, you can contact customer service for assistance. Visit the "<a href="contact/contact-players.html">Contact Us</a>" page. Then access the inquiry form here: For Players > Game Questions > Forgot Password.</p>
